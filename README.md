# Machine-Learning-Project

#### Repository for the Machine Learning project 21-22 - This repository was created by Deborah Dore and Vincenzo Imperati.

- The main file used to start the fist phase of the project is [this](main.py): you can start the file in *test mode* by
  adding *True* when executing the file.

- The main file used to start the **second** phase of the project is [this](RL/main.py). In order to start the
  reinforcement learning, you must choose a list of houses that you want simulate from *muratori_5* directory. for each
  house chosen you must insert in the corresponding house folder the files of devices that you want insert in simulation
  of the corresponding house.
