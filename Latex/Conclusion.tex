In this paper, we proposed an hour-ahead DR algorithm for HEMS, taking a machine learning approach with the aim of minimizing the user energy bill and degree of discomfort. Specifically, to overcome future price uncertainties, a steady price forecasting model based on LSTM is presented. In cooperation with the forecasted prices, multi-agent RL is adopted to make optimal decisions for different appliances. Simulation results showed that the proposed DR algorithm can handle the energy management and minimize the user energy bill and dissatisfaction costs.\\
As an example, the management of an PEV's decision-making processes has been integrated into the HEMS; one of the devices that most requires intelligent management of its energy consumption request. The evaluation results showed that the Naive Battery model is very versatile, but $T_{end}$ must be known. If you don't know $T_{end}$, the only applicable model is the Controllable Battery model, which allows you to perform better than the Non-Shiftable Battery model in scenarios where the focus is on reducing energy costs. \\
Better models were discovered than the Non-Shiftable Battery model, which interpreted the PEV battery in the absence of a charging decision making algorithm. We can thus confirm that the elaborate has succeeded in developing models capable of better managing the charging process of a PEV at home, in order to achieve a more accurate and effective management of domestic electricity.\\
