This paper proposes an hour-ahead Demand Response algorithm for Home Energy Management System. To deal with the uncertainty in future prices, a steady price prediction model based on recurrent neural network is presented.
In cooperation with forecasted future prices, multi-agent reinforcement learning is adopted to make optimal decisions for different home appliances in a decentralized manner.
